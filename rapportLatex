Every day in Tunisia, countless citizens face a bureaucratic nightmare that shouldn’t exist
in the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. A mother cannot register her child for school because the system shows
no record of his birth. A university graduate is denied a job because her name appears
differently on her diploma than in the national database. An elderly man waits months for
his pension because a single missing diacritical mark makes him invisible to government
computers.

This is more than a thesis about computer science—it is about human dignity, governmental
responsibility, and the transformative power of technology when it is designed
with empathy and purpose. In the pages that follow, we detail not just how this system
works, but why it matters for the future of Tunisia and other Arabic-speaking nations
facing similar challenges.

\chapter{General Context of the Project}

\section{Introduction}
In today’s digital era, identity management has become one of the most critical challenges
for both governments and organizations. Tunisia, like many other countries, faces
difficulties in ensuring accurate citizen identification due to fragmented systems,
orthographic variations of Arabic names, and inconsistencies across registries.
This project is situated within this context and aims to design a robust system for
Arabic identity matching, developed in collaboration with \textbf{Inetum Tunisie}.

\section{Presentation of the Host Organization}

\subsection{The Inetum Group}
Inetum is an international IT services and digital solutions company that helps
organizations in their digital transformation. It provides consulting, innovation,

\section{Domain of the Project: Arabic Identity Matching}
This project focuses on the development of an identity matching system specifically
adapted to the Arabic language. Unlike Latin-based systems, Arabic introduces challenges
such as orthographic variability, phonetic ambiguity, and transliteration issues.
The objective is to design a reliable and scalable solution that integrates seamlessly
into existing organizational workflows.

\section{Motivation and Challenges}
The motivation for this project stems from the shortcomings of current systems,
which fail to handle the complexities of Arabic names. Key challenges include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Linguistic variability:} different spellings and regional conventions.
  \item \textbf{Phonetic similarity:} multiple names sounding alike but spelled differently.
  \item \textbf{Clerical errors:} manual entry mistakes leading to inconsistencies.
  \item \textbf{Integration:} ensuring the system can adapt to multiple applications.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Management Methodology}
The project follows an \textbf{Agile methodology}, organized into iterative sprints.
This approach ensures continuous feedback, incremental development, and adaptability
to changing requirements. Each sprint focuses on a defined set of features, from
backend foundations to frontend development and workflow integration.

\section{Conclusion}
This chapter introduced the general context of the project, presented the host
organization (Inetum and its Tunisian branch), and defined the scope, motivations,
and challenges of the work. The next chapter provides a review of existing
solutions and a detailed needs analysis.
